# Extension Functions

## Why is this important?

Extension functions allow us to extend from a class or *add* onto a class without directly accessing it or it's members.
We can easily add utility methods onto a class that we can then use as a normal method on a given object!

## Setup

To run, `./gradlew :extension-functions:run`
